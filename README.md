## Project Overview
### School Performance Analytics in Power BI

End-to-end analytical project built in Power BI using a simulated electronic school grading system.

The project simulates a real-world scenario where management wants to monitor student performance trends over time and receive actionable analytical insights.

The objective of the project is to analyze academic performance trends, evaluate grade distributions, implement time intelligence calculations, and build a unified analytical product with consistent navigation and design.

The dashboard combines:

- analytical visuals,
- built-in Power BI Analytics tools,
- quick measures,
- time intelligence calculations,
- drill-through navigation,
- tooltip pages,
- standardized dashboard UX/UI design.

This project demonstrates the development of a comprehensive analytical dashboard in Power BI for an educational institution:

- data ingestion from CSV sources
- data cleaning and transformation in Power Query
- star schema data modeling
- DAX calculations
- calendar dimension creation
- interactive dashboard development
- KPI tracking and performance analysis

The solution was designed following BI and analytics best practices commonly used in production reporting environments.

## Business Problem

The dashboard answers the following business questions:

- How does the average grade change over time?
- Are there visible positive or negative trends?
- What values are considered typical (median and percentiles)?
- What performance can be expected in the next months?
- How are grades distributed across subjects?
- How does the cumulative average grade behave during the academic year?
- How does academic performance change Month-over-Month?

The goal was to transform raw operational CSV files into a clean analytical model suitable for reporting and decision-making.

## Dataset Description

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| students.csv |	Student master data |
|grades.csv |	Fact table with grade records |
| teachers.csv |	Teacher dimension |
| subjects.csv |	Subject dimension |
| periods.csv |	Academic periods |
| classes.csv |	Class dimension |
